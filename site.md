# site.md - Think about someone (perhaps the client) who already knows WordPress taking over the running of the site itself: how do they add new content such as a page or a post? In what category? You may have used a plugin for a calendar of events or something, which needs to be described. Do not recreate WordPress documentation, but clearly explain to the client's site maintainer how this particular site is organised and can be updated.

## Adding New Content
Adding new content to the site is likely to fall into a few categories

### Category 1: Public vs Private
This site is using a pluging called 'Content Control'. It lets pages and blocks (page components) to be made to not be visiable when the website visitor is not logged in. This is currently used to keep the pdf's containing the lesson's and the announcement's board  behind the organisations subscription fee/s.

Before finalising any content updates check the permissions by looking in the right hand side editing menu: Visiability for pages and Block Controls for blocks. 

### Category 2: Does it need to be Immediately Visable
As part of the client's requests for the new prospective website we (the design team) had to clean up the main menu as the client had been getting complaints from their user base (targeted towards the elderly) that there was too much 'wall's of text' and that the menu was cluttered and unclear. Rule of thumb is to avoid duplicate data, keep page names simply and clear in purpose. If you must add a new page then try to put it as a sub menu. For pages, break up the text more then usual and use Separator and 25 pixel tall Spacer blocks to seperate text sections.
