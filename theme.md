# theme.md â€“ This page should help a new developer to continue developing your theme. Include relevant information about what features your theme has, files that would need editing, design decisions, colours, etc. You do not need to produce a serious design document or reproduce basic details about WordPress theme development, only what is specific to your theme.


## Theme coding practice
- This theme is to cover general structure and has not been used for areas that are prone to change. As an example, the banner is a part of the css/header php, while the home page image is done through wordpress. 
- A starting comment and ending comment has been set as a rule to maintain structure, 
  an example is set below.

  <!-- Call to action button -->
<div id="call-to-action">
    <a href="/my-account/" class="shine-button">Start with us now!</a>

</div>
<!-- End of Call to action button -->
